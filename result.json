In the note, she took the company to task for its decision not to pay artists during an initial three-month free trial of Apple Music, the new streaming service Apple’s launching Tuesday. Swift wrote: I’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company. The letter was polite and to the point. Swift felt it unfair for Apple to use artists, especially up-and-coming ones, to grow its new service without compensating them for it. The counterargument, meanwhile, holds that the free trial could bring lots of free publicity to those same lesser-heard artists. The flaw there, however, is that Apple was asking those artists to make a leap of faith in the hopes of more followers and money in the future — but many small artists live essentially paycheck to paycheck, and they can’t stomach a quarter of reduced payouts. So in one of the most amazing changes of direction I’ve seen in my 35 years of watching Apple, Swift’s letter — and the public show of support it drummed up — got Apple to change its mind. Just hours after the note went up, Apple announced it would indeed be paying artists for their music during the free period, if at a reduced rate (other streaming services have similar practices). You might think Swift’s Apple-shaming would be a public relations disaster for the company — and at first, this is how it was portrayed in the media. But in an ironic twist, Swift’s move was wonderful for Apple and its new music service. Before Swift’s letter, only music and tech industry followers seemed truly aware of Apple Music’s imminent launch. To me, it was clear Apple would need to do lots of promotion to get significant numbers of users on board — die-hard Apple fans might have been good for as many as 15 million users off the bat, but not more than that. Because of Swift’s letter, millions more potential users are now aware of the service. But Swift’s letter did something else for Apple, too. At Fortune, fellow Apple-watcher Philip Elmer-Dewitt wrote that “the Taylor Swift effect continues to ripple across the music industry.” Elmer-Dewitt continued: According to Billboard, two independent music umbrella groups—the digital rights organization Merlin and Martin Mills’ Beggars Group—have dropped their resistance to the new Apple Music streaming service set to begin next week. Merlin and Beggars are long-tail powerhouses. Merlin represents some 20,000 independent music labels and distributors. Beggars, which dates back to the young Rolling Stones, launched the careers of Adele, Jack White, M.I.A. More artists who resisted putting their music on Apple Music are now changing their tune — thanks, in part, to Swift. What Swift ultimately did is create a win-win scenario for herself, Apple, and all artists who now have a powerful outlet to showcase their musical talents. Most of Apple’s competitors have around 15 million paying customers. My firm is predicting Apple will have at least 60 million subscribers by the end of the year, as it can ride iTunes’ massive userbase and the iOS ecosystem to quickly amass a strong audience of listeners. The result of Swift’s letter, then, is that when Apple Music service launches, it will have the richest library of available songs for potential subscribers to check out. And given Apple’s customer base, it could become the most successful streaming music service almost overnight.

I mean, it’s incredibly cute and I’d love to show it to you, but I’m also a private person, so it wouldn’t be right to go into details. But I will say this: though it’s one of my favorite possessions, this picture doesn’t physically exist. It’s not in a frame, and I don’t even have a print of it. It’s just a series of ones and zeros sitting on a server, somewhere in the world. And when I get my new iPhone X, I’ll probably immediately pull it up to look at it on Apple’s gorgeous new fullscreen display and remark how fast the kids have grown. A cliché, I know, but that doesn’t make it any less true. I can’t help myself — that’s how adorable this photo is. As precious as this image is, I don’t have it stored on a flash drive attached to my keychain, or in some other ultra-safe place. Instead, it’s housed on a server in some unknown probably dank and sunless location. That’s no casual decision. I’ve put considerable time and thought into how I store my photos in general, as well as how I back up my information overall. Despite all the bottomless storage features offered by tech giants like Google and Amazon, I default to keeping my most valuable data with Apple. Why I chose this matters, so let’s talk about it. First and foremost, there’s the issue of these companies’ business models. The goal of each outfit is to make the most money it can for its shareholders, naturally, and in that sense Apple — pricing its products at a premium — is the most visible example of the maxim. But $1,000 iPhones and pricey accessories aside, at least the company is only buttering its bread on one side. Google, by contrast, not only sells phones and other devices, but also makes money off the ads (and the user data) that appear on those handsets, laptops and tablets. Amazon’s gadget-oriented business model wants to sell you things (like Amazon Echos) that will help sell you more things (through voice ordering) — a dizzying value proposition. And then there’s Facebook, which doesn’t appear to be selling its users much of anything at this point. But look more closely and you discover Facebook’s users (and their kids’ bath time photos) are themselves the products unwittingly feeding the social network’s revenue model. The second reason I trust my kids’ naked baby photos to Apple is the company’s longstanding commitment to privacy. Succinctly outlined on Apple’s new privacy website, the company’s stance on keeping a lid on data has been catalogued not only in its marketing materials, but in its posture toward groups looking to crack its products’ embedded security. Proactivity and transparency are undervalued but essential character traits of any company I care to do business with in 2017. (That’s something I’ve come to realize in the wake of the Equifax hack.) Remember 2016’s Apple versus the FBI dust-up, which nearly turned security protocols into a question of Constitutional rights? While you can argue over Apple’s pro-encryption stance from a law enforcement perspective, what’s inescapable is the company’s commitment to keeping its users’ data locked down. Critics of Apple at the Justice Department called its fight with the FBI a marketing ploy — a claim the iPhone maker disputes. Whether you believe the company or not, Apple has only made its security stronger since then. One way it’s done so is through a technology called differential privacy. The idea behind this complex consumer protection is that through the use of cloud computing, small gadgets like iPhones can tap remote computers to have capabilities that are much bigger than their portable sizes might otherwise allow. Consider a cloud computing paradox: to get the most out of the cloud, remote servers require data — the more granular the information, the better. But data, if it’s somehow viewed or intercepted, can unmask the sender. By using differential privacy, Apple injects “noise” into its bits and bytes, rendering this information useless to third parties who might otherwise be able to view it. Wired recently explored research by a team of experts that had deconstructed Apple’s code and found its differential privacy practices to be lacking, a characterization that the company strongly disputes. But even these experts call Apple’s implementation a “good first step.” It also bodes well that the company is deploying this technology for personal data as important as my health tracking metrics and as trivial as my emoji preferences—something I doubt its competition is doing, though Google uses differential privacy in its Chrome browser, Wired points out. Still, I’d rather have a well-intentioned system that’s not yet perfect for my family photos’ sake, than one designed to monetize my data from the outset. Of course photo security is a sensitive subject for Apple. One of the company’s biggest black eyes came in 2014, when hundreds of celebrities’ accounts were hacked and their private photos were scattered across the Internet. While most certainly bad news for Apple, the method that experts believe the hackers used to crack the company’s iCloud service was simple phishing emails, which were designed to trick recipients into disclosing the passwords of their accounts. Obviously the phishing expedition worked (though only to a point, because the perpetrators are still being caught and charged, as recently as this week), and Apple’s system shares blame for being so easily exploitable. But the company reacted by making much-needed changes to its security, including the implementation of two-factor authentication, which greatly reduces the likelihood that a fraudster will take over your account. I realize locks only keep honest people out, and as long as tech companies pursue better security solutions, hackers will try to break them. Still, Apple’s singleminded focus on locking down its systems justifies the premiums it charges for its products, to me at least. Not that I’d pay any price, of course. As the iPhone X’s sticker price soared over $1,000, even I paused. But then I thought of all the systems working to make this device digitally impenetrable, security apparatuses that weren’t needed when the world-changing smartphone first arrived 10 years ago. All of these things are working in concert to make the iPhone X the most secure Apple product yet. And I can’t wait to stretch that photo of my kids across its glorious new screen. It’ll be really something — and I’m glad you won’t be able to see it. John Patrick Pullen has written about smart devices and home automation for TIME and Fortune since 2009.

{"header": "U.S. Apple Antitrust Lawsuit: What to Know | TIME", "author": "Solcyré Burga", "update/publish": "March 21, 2024 2:48 PM EDT", "link": "https://time.com/6959254/doj-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-monopoly-iphone/", "date": "March 21, 2024 2:48 PM EDT", "text": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Apple on Thursday, accusing the tech giant of maintaining a monopoly over the smartphone market.  The complaint, which was filed with 16 state and district attorneys general, argues that Apple engages in anticompetitive behavior by restricting how third-party products can interact with its products, including apps, non-Apple smartwatches, and more.  “For years, Apple responded to competitive threats by imposing a series of ‘Whac-A-Mole’ contractual rules and restrictions that have allowed Apple to extract higher prices from consumers, impose higher fees on developers and creators, and to throttle competitive alternatives from rival technologies,” said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Attorney General Merrick Garland claimed in a press conference that Apple’s dominance comes \"not by making its own products better—but by making other products worse.\" Apple argues the latest lawsuit would lead to government overreach that would restrict the company’s ability to freely design its technology. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,” said Apple in a statement. “If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect.” Apple’s shares fell more than 4% during trading on Thursday as of 2 p.m. ET.  Here’s what to know about the lawsuit.  The antitrust lawsuit alleges that Apple has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which says that anyone who monopolizes, or tries to monopolize a part of the trade or commerce industry will be guilty of a felony.  The Justice Department alleges that Apple has monopoly power over the smartphone market because it favors Apple products—think: Apple Watch or Apple Wallet—over those of third-parties. “This is about opening the smartphone market and making sure that the emerging technologies of the future, the innovation, the creativity that American consumers want is ultimately available because of cases about the future,” a DOJ official said during a Thursday press call.  The complaint claims Apple has suppressed mobile cloud streaming services, blocked apps that would make it easier for users to switch between smartphone platforms, and made cross-platform messaging worse. For instance, an app called Beeper Mini that allowed Android users to use iMessage and send texts with blue bubbles, was shut down by Apple in December 2023. Apple’s conduct, the Department alleges, affects web browsers, news subscriptions,  location services, and more. Apple argues that the lawsuit would set a “dangerous precedent” and would allow the government to “take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”  “We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,” the company added.  It is not clear what relief the DOJ is seeking under this suit or how the outcome could affect consumers. If the court rules in the DOJ’s favor, it's possible Apple could be forced to break up. A DOJ official said the consequences would have to be determined after a trial. “Equitable relief is on the table for Sherman Act Section Two violations and the range of possible remedies are supposed to not only redress violations but prevent their recurrence and fully restore competition that's been lacking in the market,” the official said.  Thursday's lawsuit is the third filed against the company by the DOJ since 2010. The department reached a settlement with Apple and five other tech companies in 2010 after they faced allegations of colluding to suppress workers’ salaries. In 2016, the company was forced to pay $450 million to settle allegations that it conspired with publishers to increase e-book prices.  In 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite, sued Apple, arguing that requiring customers to get apps through the app store and pay for digital content inside an app using Apple’s system was a monopolistic practice. A judge in 2021 required Apple to let developers give consumers other payment options, but didn't find that the company had an illegal monopoly in the issue at hand. Across the pond, the European Union confirmed that it is investigating Apple’s decision to shut down Epic Games’ developer accounts, according to TechCrunch. Apple is the last major tech giant to face a major federal antitrust case, as regulators continue to apply greater scrutiny to Big Tech practices with complaints filed against Google and Meta.  Apple has long defended its practices. In response to an E.U. antitrust complaint from Spotify in 2019, Apple said that its aim has always been to “grow the pie” and “create more opportunities not just for our business, but for artists, creators, entrepreneurs and every ‘crazy one’ with a big idea.” After a 2020 House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee report on Big Tech claimed that Apple has “monopoly power” over software distribution on iPhones, the company pushed back: “We have always said that scrutiny is reasonable and appropriate but we vehemently disagree with the conclusions reached in this staff report with respect to Apple,” Apple said in a statement at the time. “Our company does not have a dominant market share in any category where we do business.” Write to Simmone Shah at simmone.shah@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/6318369/apple-iphone-factory-india/", "https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-lawsuit-against-apple-monopolizing", "https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23987817/beeper-mini-imessage-android-reverse-engineer", "https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-six-high-tech-companies-stop-entering-anticompetitive-employee", "https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/apple-epic-dev-account-dma/#:~:text=The%20spokesperson%20also%20said%20the,and%20the%20App%20Store%20as", "https://time.com/6656392/facebook-20th-anniversary-mark-zuckerberg-meta-legacy/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/house-antitrust-subcommittee-apple-has-monopoly-power.html", "mailto:simmone.shah@time.com"]},

My goal is to get plenty of hands-on experience with all the major mobile platforms — a mandatory qualification for anyone in my line of work, as far as I’m concerned. Whenever I land back on Android, as I did when I switched from my iPhone 5 to an HTC One this week, I’m reminded of the things I like about Google’s mobile operating system. It’s far more customizable than iOS, letting me do things such as opting for a third-party keyboard like Swype. It’s neatly integrated with Google services such as Gmail and Google Maps. Its overall level of polish, once so crude, is now at least in the same ZIP code as iOS. But… Actually depending on Android to do real work reminds me that even though both iOS and Android have over a million apps, they haven’t reached parity when it comes to the ones I’m most interested in using. Leaving iOS behind means doing without Secret and Facebook’s Paper, for instance. And racing Anki’s amazing little cars is no longer an option. In some cases, an Android app is available, but lacks key features: The one for TiVo, for instance, lets you manage your DVR’s recordings but doesn’t, like, let you watch them. In other instances, an Android version is feature-complete but not as elegant as its iOS counterpart, such as with Instagram, which doesn’t let you pinch to zoom in and out of an image you’re posting, Now, it’s rare for the creators of a significant app to simply ignore Android altogether. Secret, for example, is apparently trying to hire someone to work on an Android version even as we speak, judging from its job listings. But for many companies, the Android version is what you get to work on after you’ve shipped the iOS one, leaving Google’s ecosystem in a mode of permanent catch-up. Even though about 80 percent of new smartphones shipped run Android, giving apps written for it a vastly larger theoretical customer base. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Pundits such as Business Insider’s Henry Blodget continue to argue that Android’s overwhelming market share will inevitably lead to it becoming the dominant app platform — just as Windows’ overwhelming market share led developers of PC software to focus on it and give short shrift to the Mac, thereby helping Microsoft and hurting Apple. Blodget has been making this case since at least April of 2011, when he said that Apple fans should be “scared to death” of Android’s surging market share and the likelihood that it would lead to developers favoring Google’s ecosystem. Venture capitalist Fred Wilson blogged similar sentiments at the same time. Since then, Android’s growing popularity has clearly had a positive effect on the quantity and quality of goods in Google’s app market. Here’s the thing, though: Android’s gain has not been iOS’s loss. And over the last couple of years, we seem to have reached a state of equilibrium:   (Sorry, owners of Windows Phones and BlackBerrys: Your situations are worth examining, too, but I’m not going to do it in this particular piece.) The current situation seems to me to be a largely happy one for both iOS and Android users. They’re two great platforms, each with some unique strengths and access to vast quantities of apps. But it’s not the scenario long predicted by the market share ūber alles crowd. And there aren’t even any isolated incidents that should set off little alarms in Apple’s head — a hot app or a big company announcing that it’s decided to go Android-first. So it isn’t rash to declare that we’ve reached the point where the reasonable conclusion is that market share alone is not the overriding factor. A few factors which help explain why iOS keeps its app edge come to mind:   As far as I can divine, all of these points play a part in determining the relative health of the iOS and Android platforms. Together, they matter more than the number of devices each operating system has in the field. Which leads me to wonder: If 80 percent market share isn’t enough to make Android the 800-pound gorilla of mobile app development, what percentage would be? Eighty-five percent? Ninety percent? It would be nutty, of course, to argue that Android’s failure to overcome the iOS software advantage means that Apple has nothing to be paranoid about on the app front. But maybe the big scary threat isn’t Android. Maybe it’s the same one that eventually made Windows less of an inevitable fact of life on the desktop: As cloud-based services got more and more sophisticated, and the business models behind them improved, the apps available for any particular platform stopped mattering that much. Facebook, after all, is Facebook whether you’re using it on a Windows machine, a Mac or a Chromebook. Though that hasn’t happened yet with smartphones, it probably will — not in the next year or two, but eventually. Google is as comfortable writing web services as any company on the planet, so it would presumably be O.K. How Apple would contend with a post-app era isn’t so obvious — but if I were part of the company’s brain trust, I’d be secretly formulating a game plan right now.

{"header": "Apple CEO Tim Cook: It's Time for Action on Data Privacy | Time.com", "author": null, "update/publish": null, "link": "https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502591/tim-cook-data-privacy/", "date": null, "text": "In 2019, it’s time to stand up for the right to privacy—yours, mine, all of ours. Consumers shouldn’t have to tolerate another year of companies irresponsibly amassing huge user profiles, data breaches that seem out of control and the vanishing ability to control our own digital lives. This problem is solvable—it isn’t too big, too challenging or too late. Innovation, breakthrough ideas and great features can go hand in hand with user privacy—and they must. Realizing technology’s potential depends on it. That’s why I and others are calling on the U.S. Congress to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation—a landmark package of reforms that protect and empower the consumer. Last year, before a global body of privacy regulators, I laid out four principles that I believe should guide legislation: First, the right to have personal data minimized. Companies should challenge themselves to strip identifying information from customer data or avoid collecting it in the first place. Second, the right to knowledge—to know what data is being collected and why. Third, the right to access. Companies should make it easy for you to access, correct and delete your personal data. And fourth, the right to data security, without which trust is impossible. But laws alone aren’t enough to ensure that individuals can make use of their privacy rights. We also need to give people tools that they can use to take action. To that end, here’s an idea that could make a real difference. One of the biggest challenges in protecting privacy is that many of the violations are invisible. For example, you might have bought a product from an online retailer—something most of us have done. But what the retailer doesn’t tell you is that it then turned around and sold or transferred information about your purchase to a “data broker”—a company that exists purely to collect your information, package it and sell it to yet another buyer. The trail disappears before you even know there is a trail. Right now, all of these secondary markets for your information exist in a shadow economy that’s largely unchecked—out of sight of consumers, regulators and lawmakers. Let’s be clear: you never signed up for that. We think every user should have the chance to say, “Wait a minute. That’s my information that you’re selling, and I didn’t consent.” Meaningful, comprehensive federal privacy legislation should not only aim to put consumers in control of their data, it should also shine a light on actors trafficking in your data behind the scenes. Some state laws are looking to accomplish just that, but right now there is no federal standard protecting Americans from these practices. That’s why we believe the Federal Trade Commission should establish a data-broker clearinghouse, requiring all data brokers to register, enabling consumers to track the transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place, and giving users the power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all. As this debate kicks off, there will be plenty of proposals and competing interests for policymakers to consider. We cannot lose sight of the most important constituency: individuals trying to win back their right to privacy.

The company says it’s sold over 365 million digital devices over the last five years — 50 million last quarter alone — and is currently averaging nearly $4 billion in monthly profit. It has amassed $110 billion in cash. Most insanely, this could just be the beginning: Apple is exceedingly well-positioned to take advantage of several major trends in the new digital economy. Thanks to a combination of anticipation and luck, Apple — which nearly went bankrupt before the last tech boom — is poised for even greater heights if it can continue to out-think, out-innovate and out-execute its competitors. Here are three major forces buoying Apple’s growth and pushing the company forward. Innovation: One of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ key lessons was to skate to where the puck will be, a figure of speech borrowed from hockey that boils down to anticipating the key action, and avoiding the late hit. Instead of relying on what the customer says they want — on a market research survey, for example — Jobs insisted on defining needs that consumers didn’t know they had. Millions of Americans might have been satisfied with — or at least sanguine about — their Sony Walkman mobile analog tape decks, but that was before the iPod and iTunes, which dramatically changed the music business and the way we interact with our music players. Motorola Razr flip-phones were all the rage until the iPhone demonstrated the potential of the smartphone beyond businesses to everyday users, who gained easy access to email and mobile browsing. For the first time, consumers felt like their computer was mobile. Now, the iPad has introduced an entirely new PC product line to the popular market — one that’s reshaping centuries-old traditions of paper-based reading. One need only observe New York City’s subway lines on a morning commute to understand how quickly the change from print to digital is happening. Opportunity: Three ongoing trends have created the environment for Apple to continue its ascent: Smartphones, tablets, and Asia. In March, for the first time, smartphones outnumbered basic mobile phones. Fifty percent of Americans now own a smartphone, and this secular shift has fueled an entirely new, re-enforcing industry — the “app economy.” Meanwhile, tablet sales, which were slow to catch on over the last decade, are soaring. Apple sold 11.8 million iPads, a 151% increase over last year. Now, millions of consumers are lining up to buy tablets, and with little lower-priced competition — other than the nice but comparatively limited Amazon Kindle — Apple has smartly positioned itself at the high end of this market. On the other side of the world, Asian and new developing markets are just beginning to boom — and the potential is truly staggering: hundreds of millions of possible new consumers. Apple’s Chinese sales have tripled over the last year — and that’s without the new iPad, which Apple has held back because it simply can’t produce enough of them. Some 55% of the company’s sales came from foreign countries. If Apple can keep up its innovative product pipeline, it’s easy to be very bullish about sales growth internationally. Execution: Yes, Apple CEO Cook, who took over the company after Steve Jobs died last year, inherited a good thing. But as COO over the last decade Cook played a key role in honing Apple’s razor-sharp production and supply-chain success. A low-key but extremely focused and driven operational thinker with an Alabama drawl, Cook was the obvious choice to replace the visionary Jobs. Over the course of nearly three decades, Jobs defined what success meant on Apple’s terms — and the strategy to achieve it. Cook’s responsibility has been to execute Jobs’ vision, and he’s been so successful that the company finds itself in an unusual and enviable position for a global corporate giant: Apple literally cannot produce enough of its products to meet consumer demand. Perhaps more importantly, Cook has displayed a pragmatic levelheadedness that has served Apple well following the brilliant and mercurial Jobs. Cook has moved aggressively to deal with questions about Apple’s supply-chain working conditions, particularly at Chinese industrial giant Foxconn. He’s loosened Jobs-era limits on matching corporate philanthropy. And he’s initiated a new plan to issue a dividend and buy back stock from Apple shareholders. Cook knows that he’s at the tiller of a juggernaut, and his thoughtful and poised manner has won him fans from the Apple commentariat — and the stock market. Apple shares topped $600 after-hours Tuesday and most Wall Street analysts are pointing to levels of $700 and higher over the next two years. Investors have good, fundamental reasons to be bullish about Apple — Wall Street naysayers (such as they are) notwithstanding. The company has helped define the hottest tech category — the smartphone; it’s opened the door to widespread adoption of the tablet market — with the iPad. And it’s done this, all while buoyed — and perfectly set up — for the most important economic and financial secular change of the new millennium: the emergence of the nascent, middle-class Asian consumer, fueled by rising economic growth and standards of living.", "nested_links": ["https://twitter.com/TIMEBusiness", "http://business.time.com/2012/04/24/apple-profit-soars-94-stock-up-7/?iid=biz-article-latest", "http://business.time.com/2012/04/24/apple-profit-soars-94-stock-up-7/?iid=biz-article-latest", "http://seekingalpha.com/article/524451-apple-s-ceo-discusses-q2-2012-results-earnings-call-transcript", "http://business.time.com/2012/03/01/nearly-50-of-americans-own-smartphones-android-iphone-dominate/"]},

The plague of the creative class, DWS involves the dwindling of the wrist muscles such that the afflicted can fit into those impossibly small cuff sizes on a dress shirt. (Victims are also known have impossibly smooth, uncalloused hands.) In all honesty, I’m not quite that bad off — I can open almost any jar without help — but I do still register (just barely) on the DWS spectrum. And when I saw that the Apple Watch came in two sizes, one with a 38-mm face and the other with a 42-mm face, I panicked and couldn’t help but wonder: Would I be less of a man if I bought a smaller Apple Watch? There have been many articles written about how to figure out which watch size is right for you (my favorite is this neat dollar bill-folding trick), but none help you deal with the side-eye you’ll get after buying the wrong one. So I texted my best friend, an investment banker who inherited a love of watches from his grandfather, a former watch repairman. Surely, he would surely set me straight. “Hold on. Eating a sandwich,” he replied. A few bites later, he explained that he works with people who wear $10,000 watches as a statement piece, so I should go big or go home. But one thing people don’t realize about the smaller-sized Apple Watch is that it’s already quite sizable. According to Matt Bain, Miami Beach, Fla.-based antique watch dealer, the standard size of a men’s watch today, on the smaller side, is approximately 36 mm. “Men are wearing watches all the way up to 48 mm, 48 being very large,” he says. “I think the perfect size watch for a man today is probably about a 40-mm watch.” Which, of course, is right in the middle of Apple’s sizing, and as such, is no help at all. In Bain’s expert opinion, the smaller Apple Watch should work perfectly fine for a man of my slenderness. In fact, when it comes to Apple’s watch, he seems to regard its face size like that of a touchscreen phone — it’s all about utility and being able to see and interact with the display. “I have the smaller iPhone … other people don’t even care. I think on the wrist, it’s the same thing,” he says. “Thirty-eight millimeters is still a large watch — it’s not a small watch, and I don’t consider it to be a woman’s one.” For its part, Apple claims their watches are unisex, but their bands certainly have target markets in mind. For example, the Leather Loop band, which looks rugged yet refined, will only fit the 42-mm Apple Watch. And the Modern Buckle, with its elegant, subtle styling, is only available on the 38-mm version. So, if, like me, you want a smaller watch face with the more burly leather strap, you’re out of luck, and likewise if you want a larger watch face with a demure leather band. Still torn, I decided to get a woman’s opinion. I’ve known Andrea Lavinthal, PEOPLE Magazine’s style and beauty director, since college. It turns out she’s a watch aficionado herself, owning a small collection of treasured timepieces. “When they say unisex for a watch, in my opinion, that means typically a woman can wear a men’s watch,” Lavinthal says. “But it almost never means a man can wear a woman’s watch.” Funny enough, Lavinthal does make an odd exception to this rule. In contrast to my best friend’s assertion that I should go big to show off, Lavinthal thinks I should brag by going small. According to her, guys tend to size up more than is necessary on everything from cars to clothes. “They size up in their clothing forever until they either meet a woman who gives them a makeover, or they find a really good sales person, tailor, or friend with better style who they randomly start trusting,” she says. “It almost takes an intervention to get a guy to wear the proper size clothing.” These man-childs apparently wear large and extra-large sized clothing, when they really should be sporting mediums. “Wearing the bigger size makes you look like a little person wearing a big t-shirt,” says Lavinthal. “The medium is going to fit you and actually make you look bigger.” And likewise, when it comes to this smart watch — which is still an awkward fashion piece, despite Apple’s design prowess — wearing the proper size is likely to make it less clunky. Heck, if you wear the right size, it might even look like a watch, and not a wrist-top computer. So I put the question to Lavinthal, point blank: If I bought a smaller Apple Watch, would she think I was less of a man? “No,” she responds. “I would say you’re cheaper.” And this is true: the smaller-sized Apple Sport Watch rings in at $50 less than the larger model. A watch that fits and almost enough extra cash to buy one of these lovely Nomad Apple Watch Stands? That is a stigma I can live with.
